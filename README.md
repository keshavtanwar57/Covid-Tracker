## 💡 Inspiration
### Prier this application it was a bit tedious to get the status of covid-19 cases stats of your region, earlier users had to search it on Google go through several websites then the user might get the correct stats with this I tried to solve this problem this is simple and easy to use the app. User can select their region and within seconds get stats of their local region.
## 🧑‍💻 Working
### This app is developed using flutter and dart. This app uses HTTP package and fetches all the data of different regions with the help of covid API.
